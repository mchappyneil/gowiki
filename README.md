# gowiki

This is my first attempt at building web apps in Go. This is a very simple example which allows you to view, edit, create, and save new webpages.

NOTE: This is a very rudimentary project to learn more about web development with Go so there is no CSS and utilizes "improper" HTML.

## Usage

Run the command ``` go build wiki.go``` followed by ```./wiki``` to start the program. Next, visit http://localhost:8080/view/home to edit and save the "home" page.
